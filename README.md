# Graphical Function Plotter
The Graphical Function Plotter is a Python application that allows users to visualize mathematical functions. Using matplotlib and numpy, this tool plots a given function's graph over a specified range. It's an excellent resource for educational purposes, mathematical analysis, or just for fun to see how different functions look graphically.

# Features
User-defined Functions: Plot any function input by the user, including linear, polynomial, trigonometric, and exponential functions.
Customizable Range: Automatically plots functions across a predetermined range, which can be adjusted in the code for different views or analyses.
Interactive: Uses a simple command-line interface for inputting functions, making it accessible to beginners and advanced users alike.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have installed Python 3.6 or higher on your system. This application also requires the following Python libraries:
'matplotlib'
'numpy'

# Installation

# Clone the Repository:
'git clone https://github.com/yusufdalbudak/graphical-function-plotter.git'
'cd graphical-function-plotter'

# Install Required Libraries
 'pip install matplotlib numpy' (type this in terminal)

# Usage
To run the Graphical Function Plotter, navigate to the project directory and execute:
 
 'graphical-calculator.py'

When prompted, input the mathematical function you wish to plot. For example:

 'Enter the function you wish to plot (e.g., 'x**2', 'np.sin(x)'): x**2'

The plot will be displayed in a new window. You can enter new functions as many times as you like.
